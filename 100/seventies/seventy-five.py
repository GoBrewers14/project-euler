# It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to

# are many more examples.

# In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
# integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one
# solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form
# exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

# Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of
# L â‰¤ 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be
# formed?
